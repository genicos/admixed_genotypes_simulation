Run this command
./sim_coalesence {population size} {number of generations diverged}

Ex: ./sim_coalesence 10000 500000

This command creates a panel template which is used in the next stage
to create ahmm panels.

It calls the program macs, a coalesence simulator that generates SNP diversity for two populations. These two populations descend from a single ancestral populations, that split into two populations of size N diploid individuals

                | |      --Ancestral population
                | |
                /  \     --population split T gens ago
               / /\ \
              / /  \ \ 
             / /    \ \  --Two pops A and B, both of size N


The first seven columns of the panel template are the same as an ahmm panel. Colums eight and nine are SNPs from 1000 haploids from population A and B.
